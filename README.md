# XSSwatchingPro

XSSwatchingPro is an automated tool for testing XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerabilities on specified domains. It allows users to check the security of web applications against common XSS attack vectors using customizable payloads.

## Features

- Load custom payloads from a specified file.
- Supports both GET and POST HTTP methods for testing.
- Displays real-time analysis of potential XSS vulnerabilities.
- Saves test results to a file named according to the domain tested.
- User-friendly color-coded output in the terminal.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (install using `pip install requests`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/XSSwatchingPro.git
   cd XSSwatchingPro
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python xsswatchingpro.py
   ```

2. Input the following when prompted:

   - **Target Domain**: Enter the domain you want to test (e.g., `https://example.com`).
   - **Payload File Path**: Provide the path to your payload file (e.g., `/path/to/payloads.txt`).
   - **HTTP Method**: Choose either `GET` or `POST`.

3. Review the results displayed in the terminal. If vulnerabilities are found, they will be highlighted with appropriate emojis.

4. The results will be saved to a file named according to the target domain. For example, if the domain is `kali.org`, the results will be saved as `kali-result.txt`. If this file already exists, subsequent results will be saved as `kali-result1.txt`, `kali-result2.txt`, etc.

## Example

```bash
üîó Enter the target domain (e.g., https://example.com): https://example.com
üìÅ Enter the path to the payload file: /path/to/payloads.txt
üìú Choose the HTTP method (GET/POST): GET
```

### Sample Output

- **Vulnerability Found**:
  ```
  üí• Possible XSS vulnerability found: https://example.com?payload=<script>alert('xss')</script> with payload: <script>alert('xss')</script>
  ```

- **No Vulnerability Found**:
  ```
  ‚ùé No vulnerability found; URL is safe: https://example.com?payload=<script>console.log('test')</script> with payload: <script>console.log('test')</script>
  ```

- **Connection Error**:
  ```
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Error connecting to server; URL is not accessible for testing: https://example.com?payload=<script>alert('fail')</script>
  ```

- **Results Saved**:
  ```
  ‚úÖ Results saved to example-com-result.txt
  ```

## Warning

- **Security**: Be cautious when testing websites that you do not own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized testing can be considered illegal and may lead to severe consequences.
- **Payloads**: The tool's effectiveness depends on the payloads used. Ensure that you are using relevant and updated payloads to maximize the chances of detecting vulnerabilities.
- **Network Traffic**: Monitor your network traffic when using this tool, as some websites may flag repeated requests as malicious activity.
- **Responsibility**: This tool is intended for educational and ethical hacking purposes only. Always adhere to ethical guidelines and legal regulations while using this software.
